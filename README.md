A Tier-Based Champion Recommendation System Considering Champion Synergy and Win Rate Based on League of Legends Champion Attributes

League of Legends is a team-based MOBA game where strategic champion selection significantly impacts the outcome of matches. However, many players tend to stick to familiar champions, making it difficult for them to explore new options. Additionally, they often prioritize personal preferences over team synergy when selecting champions. This tendency can hinder the overall team composition and prevent players from fully considering counter-matchups, ultimately reducing the likelihood of making optimal choices in the game.

From my personal experience, I frequently find myself struggling to decide between picking a champion I am most confident with and one that has strong synergy within the team composition. In such cases, it is not always clear whether choosing a champion I excel at is more beneficial or if selecting a champion that enhances team synergy would increase the chances of winning.

To address this issue, I aim to develop a system that predicts win rates based on champion characteristics and synergies, considering tier and team composition. This system will recommend champions that maximize win probability while also encouraging players to explore champions they do not frequently use. By doing so, it will help players make more strategic selections, expand their playstyles, and ultimately enhance their overall gaming experience with deeper engagement and refined tactical decision-making.
